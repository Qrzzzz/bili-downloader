### Added

- Initial public release preparation.
- Repository-level documentation, compliance notes, security policy, contribution guide, issue template, PR template, release checklist, and ignore rules.

- Deterministic b23 and multi-part parsing, strict cross-part quality checks, monotonic batch progress, and partial-result reporting.
- Automated lifecycle, privacy, download, configuration, logging, Playwright, and packaging regression gates.

### Fixed

- Native crashes when QR login succeeded, was cancelled, timed out, or the dialog was closed.
- Stale parsed targets remaining downloadable after the URL changed or a later parse failed.
- Unsafe shutdown while parsing, validating a session, downloading, or waiting for FFmpeg.
